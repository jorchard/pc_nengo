Here is a description from William Pugsley.
- anova.ipynb has all the code for running the statistical tests and creating the boxplots/histograms
- train_population.ipynb has the code to train the 45 PC networks, save/load their weights, and run all the convergence tests
- Phase_Space.ipynb has all the code to create the plots of the activities in each layers
- stimuli_data.py and image_net_data.py have all the functions to load and process the images into dataloaders
- All the .py files that begin with J_ are originally from Jeremy but I have made quite a few changes to some of them (particularly J_Model.py)
- The connection weights for each of the 45 networks are saved in the Weights folder
- The response times are saved in feature_combinations_... .csv and feature_number_... .csv (the response times of the networks to different combinations of features and this same information grouped into parafoveal feature number respectively)
